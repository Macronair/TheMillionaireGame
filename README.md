To use the online features of Fastest Finger First, you need to setup the following:
1. Open the 'FFF Server' in the application. At first, Windows Firewall asks if you want to allow this program. Click 'Allow' or 'Yes'.
2. On your router, port *3818* must be open so that other people can join.
3. The contestants need to have the application 'FFF_Client.exe' to connect to your FFF session. In the texbox, enter the needed IP address.
4. Choose the preferred player slot (1-8).
5. When the 'Connect' button on the client changes to 'Disconnect', then the contestant is connected.
