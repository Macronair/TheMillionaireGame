A custom game controller software like WWTBAM.

This software can be used to run your own Who Wants To Be A Millionaire games. For example at home, on Discord with friends or on a Youtube video/livestream.
There will be new features in the future to play around with. But there are a lot of elements that you can use:
- Max. 4 lifelines.
- Host and Contestant screen
- TV/Livestream screen
- Fastest Finger First (online)
- Risk Mode
- Compatible with Microsoft SQL Server (local and server)
- Easy to use Questions editor.

New features, releases, suggestions and issues will be documented in this GitHub repository.
